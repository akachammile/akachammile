## Current Projects

* 🔍 **[multi-agent-design-patterns]([https://github.com/akachammile/multi-agent-design-patterns.git)]** - Multi-Agent Design Patterns Lab: A full-stack LLM practical project.
* It covers everything from the fundamentals of LLM training and fine-tuning (Transformer/BERT), to the construction of standardized single-agent architectures, and onto complex multi-agent collaboration (Swarm) designs.
* It also delves into the source code of frameworks like LangChain to systematically master the core technologies of large model application development.

## What I'm Learning
* **Advanced Multi-Agent Patterns** (Swarm)
* **Model Alignment** (RLHF, DPO implementation)
* **Rust** (For high-performance agent runtime)
